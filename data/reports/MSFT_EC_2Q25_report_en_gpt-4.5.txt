# Microsoft Q2 FY25 Earnings Call Report

---

## Executive Summary

Microsoft delivered robust financial and operational performance in Q2 FY25, reflecting phenomenal growth in AI-driven services and strong cloud adoption. Revenue reached $69.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year, while operating income rose substantially by 17%, benefiting from efficient operational management. Microsoft's Cloud revenues surpassed $40 billion, driven primarily by Azure and strong AI demand, exceeding a $13 billion annual revenue run rate, representing a remarkable 175% year-over-year growth rate.

Highlights include:

- Total Microsoft Cloud revenue of $40.9 billion (+21% Y/Y).
- AI-driven revenue surpassing expectations, led by Azure services (up 157%), and adoption of comprehensive AI solutions like Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, and Security Copilot.
- Rapid Copilot seat adoption expanded over 10x within the last 18 months. Copilot's daily users more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, with usage intensity up 60%.
- Strong commercial bookings growth of 67%, primarily from Azure and extensive enterprise commitments (e.g., OpenAI partnership).
- Gross margin of 69%, marginally improved Y/Y, driven by favorable product mix in gaming and search despite slightly pressured margins due to scaling AI infrastructure. Operating margins expanded two percentage points to reach an impressive 45%.
- Effective operating expense management, with expenses up only 5% amid stable headcount.

## Business Segment Performance

### Productivity and Business Processes
- Revenue: $29.4 billion (+14%, +13% constant currency).
- Growth driven by significant Microsoft 365 commercial strength, especially E5 premium offerings and expanded Copilot adoption. Noteworthy transactional purchases tied to Office 2024 launch.
- Dynamics 365 exhibited healthy momentum (19% growth), significantly gaining competitive share from legacy providers.
- LinkedIn Premium crossed $2 billion annual revenue with subscription growth of nearly 50% over two years, though LinkedIn Talent Solutions showed signs of weakness.

### Intelligent Cloud
- Revenue: $25.5 billion (+19%), slightly impacted by FX headwinds.
- Azure grew 31%, driven by intense AI workload adoption, offset slightly by execution challenges in non-AI cloud services and slower purchasing cycles for on-premises servers.
- Microsoft doubled Azure data center capacity over past three years, achieving record capacity additions last year.
- Microsoft Fabric rapidly reached 19,000 paid customers, making it the fastest-growing analytics product.
- Azure AI Foundry quickly surpassed 200,000 active users shortly after launch.

### More Personal Computing
- Revenue stable at $14.7 billion, with improved operating profitability (+32%) driven by high-margin mix shifts and effective cost management.
- Windows OEM revenue (+4%) benefited from inventory build-ups ahead of Windows 10 end-of-support and tariff uncertainties.
- Gaming revenues slightly lower overall (-7%) due to weak hardware sales, partly mitigated by Xbox content/services gains (+2%) supported by successful Call of Duty launch, record Game Pass adoption, and enhanced Xbox cloud gaming usage.
- Bing and Edge market share continued climbing significantly, with Edge surpassing 30% market share in the U.S. on Windows.

## AI Investments and Infrastructure

Microsoft highlighted significant AI-related achievements and strategic progress:

- Continued aggressive infrastructure investments doubled overall data center capacity over three years.
- Strong adoption of Copilot products across enterprise (M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot), reflecting dramatically increased customer seat purchases and usage intensity across multiple industries (e.g., Novartis, Barclays, Lenovo, Ecolab).
- AI infrastructure scaling slightly impacted margins but efficiency advancements like DeepSeek and inference optimizations significantly lowered AI computing cost (10x gains per optimization cycle), enabling broader application deployments.
- Enhanced partnership with OpenAI, driving large Azure commitments and exclusive hosting of OpenAI APIs.

## Financial Management and Capital Expenditure

- Capital expenditures reached $22.6 billion in Q2 due to significant AI and cloud infrastructure scaling; around half allocated to long-term assets.
- Cash flow from operations grew 18%, driven strongly by cloud billings but offset partly by higher supplier payments and tax outflows, resulting in a 29% decline in free cash flow.
- Returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases during the quarter.
- Future capital expenditure expected to gradually align more closely with revenue-linked customer commitments (e.g., Azure, OpenAI agreements), shifting infrastructure investments accordingly.

## Future Outlook

Microsoft provided measured yet optimistic forward guidance and reaffirmed its commitment to double-digit full-year growth:

### Segment-Specific Guidance (Next Quarter):
