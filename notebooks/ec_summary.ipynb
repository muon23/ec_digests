Furthermore, the company's artificial intelligence (AI) business has also grown significantly, reaching an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% YoY. Microsoft is focused on scaling its fleet globally, addressing demand and balancing resources across training and inference. The company's cloud platform, Azure, continues to expand its data center capacity to meet demand, with total data center capacity more than doubling in the last three years.

      "Microsoft is focused on constantly modernizing and upgrading its fleet to maintain an optimal balance of monetization and expenditure. The firm has close to $300 billion in RPO, consisting of customer contracts that need delivery. Investments are being made in AI and cloud infrastructure, which will pivot to more CPU and GPU, correlating more directly with revenue. This aligns with the overall aim to efficiently deliver on customer contracts. Two new services, M365 co-pilot and O1, a feature on Copilot, have been recently launched. Reduction in inference cost has allowed once premium-tier features to become more ubiquitous. This trend is expected to continue across Microsoft's portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0012===\n",
      "Microsoft has launched a \"think harder\" feature called O1 on Copilot, which aims to make premium-tier features more widely available. This approach is also reflected across the company's portfolio including GitHub Copilot and Security Copilot. Microsoft considers using a mix of proprietary and open models on Azure, maintaining the importance of using the best available models and optimizing them. Investments are being made in foundry, an app server, to handle the influx of models and reduce development and AI ops cost. Microsoft CoPilot's usage has increased, particularly in areas such as sales, finance and supply chain. This collaborative tool has begun at departmental levels in enterprises but is quickly spreading company-wide due to its benefits in cross-functional collaboration.\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0013===\n",
      "Microsoft noted increased collaboration across functions with their tools, initially starting at departmental levels and then spreading enterprise-wide. In terms of financial performance, their Commercial RPO increased by $39 billion sequentially. Microsoft attributed the growth to a combination of a large Azure commitment from OpenAI, the addition of new tools to existing contracts, a good E5 quarter, and large Azure commitments. It was noted that this growth is not just a one-off event, but represents consistent strong execution across their workloads.\n"
