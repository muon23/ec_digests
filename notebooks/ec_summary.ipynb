      "Microsoft's segment gross margin dollars saw a 12-13% increase, while gross margin percentage decreased by four points due to AI infrastructure scaling. Operating expenses saw a 10% increase, and operating income rose by 14%. More personal computing revenue remained nearly the same at $14.7 billion, but exceeded expectations due to various factors such as Windows OEM pre-builts and Call of Duty's gaming performance. Commercial inventory builds around Windows 10 and tariff uncertainty drove a 4% YoY increase in Windows OEM and devices revenue. Search and news advertising revenue XTAC also surpassed expectations with a 21% (20% in constant currency) increase because of a third-party partnership. Gaming revenue declined by 7-8%. Total company capital expenditure aligned with predictions at $22.6 billion, and operational cash flow was $22.3 billion, marking an 18% increase. Despite the high capital expenditures, free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% YoY. Microsoft returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In terms of projected Q3 results, increased strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total revenue growth by two points, while the demand for Microsoft's cloud and AI offerings is expected to provide another quarter of strong growth. Commercial bookings are expected to be flat YoY, and Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage is likely to be around 69%, lower than previous due to AI infrastructure scaling. Revenue growth of 11-12% is expected in productivity and business processes.\n",

      "Microsoft expects stable execution across core annuity sales with potential quarterly volatility in booking growth due to unpredictable Azure contracts. The firm expects its cloud gross margin to be around 69%, a decrease year-over-year due to scaling its AI infrastructure. Revenue growth is forecasted in productivity and business processes (11-12%), Microsoft 365 commercial cloud (14-15%), LinkedIn (low to mid-single digits), and Dynamics 365 (mid-teens). M365 commercial products are expected to have unchanged revenue. The quarterly revenue growth can vary due to differing contract mixes. The Intelligent Cloud's revenue is projected to increase between 19-20%, driven by Azure, expecting a revenue growth of 31-32%. The on-premises server business is projected to experience a decline in mid-single digits. Personal computing revenue is expected to be between $12.4 and $12.8 billion. Gaming is forecasted to grow in low single digits. Operating expense is projected to increase between 5-6%. The Q3 effective tax rate is expected to be around 18%.\n",

      "Microsoft's Xbox content services revenue growth is predicted to be in the low-to-mid single digits, with first-party content and Xbox Game Pass as key drivers. However, hardware revenue is expected to decline year over year. Company guidance for COGS expects a growth between 19% and 20% in constant currency, equating to $21.65 to $21.85 billion, and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6%, between $16.4 and $16.5 billion. Other income and expenses should be at a negative $1 billion, primarily due to equity method investments. For Q3, the estimated effective tax rate will be around 18%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in Q4 revenue, COGS growth, and operating expenses falling by more than one point. The spend in Q3 and Q4 should remain at similar levels to Q2, while FY26 involves continuous investments against strong demand signals, albeit at a lower growth rate than FY25. The company anticipates double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the full fiscal year, and an increase in FY25 operating margins year over year. The FY25 full-year effective tax rate is expected to be between 18 and 19 percent.\n",

      "Microsoft's recent quarter saw strong commercial bookings, but the performance of Azure, its cloud computing service, was disappointing as it was at the lower end of the guidance range. This was said to be due to difficulties in what Microsoft refers to as the \"scale motions,\" primarily concerning customers reached indirectly through partners. The points of concern are about getting the balance right in terms of investments, marketing dollars, and sales operations. Adjustments are being made, but these changes may take time to show effect. In contrast, Azure AI performed better than expected due to good work by the operating teams in managing delivery dates. For the next quarter, Microsoft expects continued constrained capacity, as was the case last year. This is due to required resources such as space and kits, but the company has been making long-term investments to achieve a balance by the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0009===\n",
      "Microsoft's AI growth rate is reportedly better than expected, with workloads scaling well, including regular data storage services such as chat GPT, copilot, and enterprise AI workloads. The company intends to lean into this success rather than resting on past wins. Microsoft's AI revenue is driven largely by Azure and the larger-than-expected success of Microsoft Co-Pilot. The company sees significant improvements per cycle in software optimizations on inference due to AI scaling laws and aims to capitalize on this trend. As inference computing prices fall, Microsoft expects increased consumption and app development.\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0010===\n",
      "Microsoft shared how improvements in AI pre-training and inference time computing are making AI more ubiquitous. The company stated that this was beneficial for large-scale providers, such as Microsoft itself, and it would lead to broader application of the technology, such as running models that would usually require cloud infrastructure on a PC. Microsoft mentioned that the partnership with OpenAI is still strong and is generating benefits that are not yet fully realized. In managing its fleet of AI services, the company is aiming for a balance between inference and training, geo-distribution, and software optimization. One of its goals is to reduce the cost of AI services so they can be consumed broadly. The company also highlighted the importance of fleet optimization, continuous upgrading, and maintaining a healthy balance between monetization and training expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0011===\n",
      "Microsoft is managing its technology resources carefully to align with Moore's law and to reflect an optimal ratio of monetization and demand. Microsoft's current portfolio of customer contracts (RPO) is near $300 billion. The company is working to deliver these contracts as quickly and efficiently as possible, not only for OpenAI partnership but also for its entire platform. The company is investing in AI infrastructure and commercial cloud but is set to pivot towards more CPU and GPU, which will be more closely correlated to revenue. The expenditure on these areas will either be via partnerships like OpenAI or directly through them. Their capital expenditure growth reflects a cycle pivot, which is more related to customer contract delivery. Microsoft is also evolving its go-to-market approach to be able to fulfill the needs of a larger range of customers. Two recent product upgrades mentioned include a Copilot Chat in M365 and an O1-powered feature in Copilot. These examples were given as an indication of how costs coming down can drive more utilization of premium tier features. Similar changes will be seen across Microsoft's entire product range.\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0012===\n",
      "Microsoft has launched O1 'Think Harder' feature on Copilot, making it available globally. This is part of their strategy to make once premium features more ubiquitous due to reduced costs from optimised inference. This trend can be seen across Microsoft's portfolio, including Security Copilot and Github Copilot. Regarding the use of proprietary versus open-source models, Microsoft sees benefits in both, with continual investment in optimizing them for different applications. The company is also investing significantly in 'Foundry' to facilitate this process. The Copilot feature has had positive uptake, particularly in areas where immediate productivity can be seen, such as sales teams and supply chains. However, as collaboration across functions increases, there is a demand for broader application throughout enterprises.\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0013===\n",
      "Microsoft is seeing increased collaboration across enterprise functions with people integrating AI into their daily work habits, often starting at departmental level before expanding. This has resulted in the creation of co-pilot chat to increase flexibility for enterprise customers.
