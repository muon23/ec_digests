      "Microsoft's commercial bookings were solid, but Azure revenue came in at the lower end of guidance. This was due to execution issues in the non-AI Azure business, specifically concerning \"scale motions\" relating to customers reached through partners and indirect sales methods. The company made adjustments to sales motions over the summer to better balance AI workloads with migrations and other fundamentals. While AI Azure performance exceeded expectations due to good execution and capacity management, Microsoft expects some impact from the non-AI adjustments in H2. Q3 guidance remains unchanged at $31-32 billion, partly because Microsoft is able to land the revenue on the AI side of the business and still is working in a capacity constraint environment. Growth in regular storage and data services underneath emerging AI workloads is encouraging. However, the non-AI ACR is undergoing scale motions in H2.\n",
      "\n",
      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0009===\n",
      "Microsoft is seeing strong growth in its AI initiatives. Azure AI performed well, and Microsoft Copilot adoption exceeded expectations, driven by both new and expansion seats, strong usage, and favorable pricing. AI growth rates are better than expected, benefiting significantly from scaled workloads and solid related storage and data service growth. Enterprise workloads are scaling well and Microsoft will focus on design wins when tweaking incentives with market shifts. Continued optimization is being made on software for inference.\n",

      "===MSFT_EC_2Q25_0010===\n",
      "Microsoft is seeing significant improvements in AI inference efficiency through software optimizations, potentially allowing them to run powerful AI models more ubiquitously, even on devices like PCs. They see falling token and inference computing prices as a positive driver for AI adoption and applications. The company emphasizes a flexible, geo-distributed fleet optimized for both training and inference. Microsoft is balancing ongoing investments in AI infrastructure with the constant need to upgrade hardware and software to drive monetization and demand for AI services, suggesting it is committed to balancing capital expenditures, and the ability to scale. The company is happy about its partnership with OpenAI which commits to Azure and believes the success of OpenAI is also their success.\n",

      "The CapEx investment encompasses building data centers, enhancing the commercial cloud infrastructure, and shifting towards CPU and GPU resources. This pivot will directly correlate with revenue, and the investments support inference workload training and the requirements of running the commercial cloud. Microsoft aims to continuously upgrade and modernize its infrastructure to maintain cost efficiency and scalability, balancing monetization with 'training' expenses.

      "Microsoft is seeing inference optimization and cost reductions allowing for wider availability of previously premium AI features in products like Copilot. This trend extends across their portfolio, including GitHub Copilot and Security Copilot. They emphasize the importance of frontier models but also highlight the use of diverse models (built, fine-tuned, distilled, even open-source) in their applications. Microsoft is investing heavily in \"foundry\" as an app server, which helps developers leverage the rapid innovation in AI models (open source, closed source, and various weight classes) while managing operational costs (AI ops) to keep pace with innovation so all apps can benefit from it in an \"evergreen way\". Regarding Copilot adoption, initial traction is observed in departments prioritizing immediate productivity gains (sales, finance, supply chain). The expansion across the enterprise is driven by collaborative workflows which require it to become a more standard issue across the enterprise. To facilitate wider adoption, more flexibility is built, such as being able to start with co-pilot chat, this gives enterprise customers something that's more ubiquitous.\n",

While an Azure commitment from OpenAI was a significant driver, core business motions like contract renewals and add-ons such as GitHub Copilot, plus strong E5 performance within M365, also contributed. Growth in large Azure commitments came from both existing customers increasing their commitments and new customer acquisitions, indicating broad-based demand.\n",
